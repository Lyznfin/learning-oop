#  CMD RPG

Im trying to create a turn based RPG purely with OOP principles for learning purpose.

2 months update, its sucked. Too much redundancy, couldve used some of them DRY, uncalled ammount of unnecessary complexity, shouldve used property (why do I even encapsulate every attribute in the first place, dammit), where game loop, perhaps it should connect to a database, what is even an abstract class, shouldve make the classes more modular.

I could rewrite this on the side, make it a package, and create an API out of this, later (I'm procrastinating).
